=Informal Specification=

A computer game version of the code breaking game mastermind is to be made. This version of the game will be a race between two players to see which one can break the others code first, meaning that the computer AI and human players will play both code breakers and makers. Whoever solves the code first wins.
There will be two separate game boards to represent the progress of each player. There is only one human player and one computer AI player. Buttons for selecting coloured pegs, ending a turn, or exiting the game will be used, within two different menu states. The first state being the Game_Menu state and the second being the Game_Board state.
