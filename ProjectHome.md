Main objective:

A game of mastermind where two people compete by both trying to break each other's hidden code, before their opponent, over a network.

Current capabilities:

> It allows for a user to play against a computer opponent with sensible AI.
> The current version only supports user vs computer mode.
( Note this is not complete, network support and Player vs Player modes to be added. PSP  version to be released after this over the summer, most likely after employment found)

> Note on current downloads: To run the debug compilation from the downloads section you need to have Visual Studio Express C++ installed. I will upload a release version when I have time to recompile the code so that you don't need to have Visual Studio installed.
